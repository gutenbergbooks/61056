What is the Royal Jelly?</h3>

<hr class="r25" />

<p class="center">C. J. ROBINSON.</p>

<hr class="r25" />

<blockquote>
<p>I propose, by permission, to discuss
in the columns of the <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span>
the hitherto puzzling problem: “What
is royal jelly, that substance known
to produce the transformation of worker
larv&aelig; to queens?” Profound scientists of
Europe and this country have delved
into the secrets of the grand problem,
but none of them have handed down a
satisfactory solution. Yet, it does not
seem rational that the question is so obstruse
as to forever remain past finding
out what the so-called royal jelly consists
of; the source from which it is derived;
its definite action on larv&aelig;;
and whether it is administered by the
workers as a nourishing aliment to larv&aelig;;
in royal cells, or for the purpose of impregnating
the larv&aelig;; (as pistilliferous
flowers are impregnated with pollen)
and thus develop a female bee fully
qualified to reproduce males. The settled
doctrine of writers on bee-matters
is that it is chiefly due to the excess of
food served to the larva by the workers
that produces the transformation from
worker to queen. Still no writer has
ventured to assert that such is a demonstrated
fact. The late Baron of Berlepsch,
the able expounder of the Dzierzon
Theory, and the most scientific and
practical apicultural writer and experienced
apiarist in all Europe, wrote
thus:</p>

<p>“Every hypothesis, however, yet submitted
from any quarter, rest chiefly
upon the assumption that the development
(of fertile workers and queens)
has by some means been over-stimulated
for a brief period, and as the result
affects the sexual organs more especially,
the quantity and quality of the
food administered has been looked to as
the exciting cause.”</p>

<p>If his assumption be admitted then
individual female bees are very likely
to be reproduced imperfectly developed
in all the degrees between a rudimentary
fertile worker up to a perfect
queen. Furthermore, were it true that
development depends on quantity of
food or the over-stimulating caused by
high feeding, the workers would be able
to supply themselves with queens at all
times; when on the contrary it is well
known that workers cannot always perfect
queens when furnished with everything
necessary for that purpose except
the impregnating principle&mdash;semen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A full knowledge of the reproduction of the honey bee is of great
importance, and at the very foundation of the science of bee-culture
and of great value to those who intend to breed the superior races of
bees, especially the principles of hybridizing so as to prevent their
deterioration and improve the breeds. And it is of great moment to
the science of entomology to determine whether insects are produced
by parthenogenesis, as is believed, or by semen received by the male
progenitors. As for myself, I have conclusive evidence that such queens
as are reproduced by furnishing a colony of black bees with eggs laid
by an Italian queen, is in some degree hybridized.</p>

<p>All of the points in the “Dzierzon Theory” have been demonstrated
except his theory of the reproduction of bees, particularly drones and
queens. It seems that he was sorely puzzled in his profound research
to comprehend the laws involved in the strange phenomena&mdash;virgin
queens reproducing male bees&mdash;and to dispose of the (to him)
inexplicable point in his colossal theory, he jumped at a conclusion
which was based upon the hypothetical doctrine advanced by Professors
Von Seibold, Leuckart, and Dr. Donhoff, the fathers of the theory
called “Parthenogenesis,” that is procreating without male sperm. It
was during the period that Dr. Dzierzon was making public his theory
that Mr. Elihu Kirby, of Henrietta, N. Y., attempted to make known the
result of his long-time and attentive research into the principles of
reproduction of the different races of honey bees. He was a scientific
apiarist of long experience,
and enthusiastic in the cause of
progressive bee-culture. Not until 1861
was there published or circulated in
this country a periodical devoted to bee
affairs and scarcely no attention was given
to scientific bee-culture at that time.
Mr. K. communicated to the <span class="smcap">American
Bee Journal</span> at different times just
after its advent, the discoveries he had
made relative to the reproduction of
bees, but not much attention was given
it further than a brief notice by the editor,
the lamented Samuel Wagner,
who, like the great Dzierzon, seemed
not to comprehend the evolution of the
reproduction of insects.</p>

<p>During the period of 1859–63, Mr.
Kirby was in failing health, and when
in the summer of 1863, he was about to
bid adieu to his long-cherished theme
and go from the altar of home on earth
to a heavenly inheritance, he besought
me to further his designs and he committed
to my charge his new theory of
the reproduction of drones and female
bees. The result of the case thus consigned
to me is as follows, conclusions
that I have come to derive from careful
observations for many seasons, viz.,
<i>videlicet</i>.</p>

<p>To produce drones the workers fecundate
the worker larv&aelig; in royal cells
with drone’s semen, which gives the elements
of queens. The workers supply
the said larva with animal secretion,
water, bee-bread and honey, until it secretes
sufficient material for a queen,
and when the larva arrives at maturity
it is then metamorphosed to an egg
substance, from thence it passes to a
chrysalis state, and in the pupa
state her ovary is formed and impregnated
with semen retained in the larva
state imparting the elements of life.
She then leaves her cell and is prepared
to lay eggs that produce drones only,
without further fecundation, and when
the drones are matured from their natural
genital propensities deposit their
semen in the queen’s spermatheca to
enable her to fecundate her full grown
eggs to produce workers, and also deposit
semen where the workers can obtain
it in the abscence of the drones, to
perfect queens, and for storing it in
their combs, where it retains its vitality
at least from the time that the drones
are expelled until they are reproduced
the following season. It is ascertained
that the drones and queens can be hybridized
by their drone progenitors in
the embryo state, which is conclusive
evidence of their being fecundated with
drones’ semen.</p>

<p>To produce workers the drones deposit
their sperm in the queen’s spermatheca
while on the wing (and on top,
clasping the drone’s back to herself)
and from thence she fecundates full
grown eggs, as they pass the mouth of
her spermatheca on the way out of her
oviduct, and by the combining of the
elements of the drone and worker in
one, by which the worker is produced.
Thus, there can be no logical reasoning
in saying that the workers are produced
by semen, and the drones and queens
are produced without semen.</p>

<p>To produce queens the worker fecundates
the worker larv&aelig; in royal cells
with drone’s semen which gives the elements
of the drone, worker and queen,
combined in one, in the larval state; it
secretes in its growth the proper material
for perfect queens, and when the
larva arrives at maturity it is transformed
to an egg-form, and then to a
chrysalis, and in that state her embryo
ovary is formed and impregnates in the
upper points or sacks of her ovary, and
contains the elements of myriads of
drone egg germs before leaving her cell,
and her physiology is changed in her
transition from the chrysalis state to a
perfect queen, and is qualified before
leaving her cell to lay eggs that will
produce drones only. To be fully qualified
to produce workers she must receive
a deposit of semen from the
drone in her spermatheca. If once
filled with semen it is efficacious through
life, and qualifies her to fecundate the
full grown drone eggs as they pass the
mouth of her spermatheca, and causes
them to produce workers, and to lay all
the eggs, both male and female and
workers, that the colony may require.
It is ascertained that the embryo drone,
workers and queen can each be hybridized
in the ovary, egg or larva state,
which is communicated to the whole
production. I think the evidence conclusive
in the reproduction of the queen.
The fertile workers are produced by the
workers taking the drone’s semen into
their stomachs, and from thence it is
transmitted to their embryo ovary, and
fecundates it, which gives the elements
of life to the progeny, and qualifies
them to lay eggs which produce drones
only, unless the eggs are further fecundated
by being brought into contact
with semen. It appears that the young
queen’s ovary on leaving her cell, and
the ovary of the fertile worker when fecundated, are
identical in the production
of drone eggs. Therefore, the evidence
is that semen is the agent in both cases.</p>

<p>I wish to call attention particularly
to the following points: 1st. The embryo
ovary of young queens must be
fructified before she leaves her cell with
drone’s semen, which gives the elements
of life to her drone progeny, and forms
the basis for the whole progeny of bees.
To produce the 3 sexes of bees there
are 3 distinct fecundations. 1st. The
embryo ovary of the pupa queen to
produce the drones. 2d. The full
grown egg to produce the workers. 3d.
The worker larva is fecundated by the
workers with semen, given off by the
drones to produce the queens. And
all in the larval state the secrete sufficient
material to perfect in their transition
either drones, workers or queens,
and they each can be hybridized in the
embryo state.</p>

<p>2d. In the reproduction of bees there
are 2 distinct egg forms: 1st. The eggs
that produce the larva. 2d. The larva
when it arrives at maturity is transformed
to an egg substance, of which
it forms the chrysalis that produces the
perfect bees and their sexes.</p>

<p>3d. It requires 3 states of existence to
perfect the organism of bees. 1st. The
larva. 2d. The chrysalis. 3d. The perfect
bee. The queen first deposits her
eggs in the proper cells or utricals in
which the larva is hatched and supplied
by the workers with animal secretion
and food until their transition to an egg
substance or chrysalis.</p>

<p>I will propose the following question
for consideration: What is it that is
found in the royal jelly that is possessed
of such impregnating powers as to
cause the ovaries of the workers to produce
drone eggs?</p>

Putting Wires into Comb Foundation.</h3>

<p class="center">J. G. WHITTEN.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. John F. Cowan, in his article on
“The Practical use of Foundation,”
published in the <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span> of
March 9, says: “It has been practically
demonstrated to my satisfaction that
these results can only be obtained by
Mr. Given’s method of introducing the
wires, and if by a happy combination
the Dunham foundation could be made
and wired by the Given or a similar
process, the foundation controversy
would be virtually ended.”</p>

<p>I would like to say to Mr. Cowan and
others who may be interested, that last
season I hived about 40 full sized natural
colonies, on Dunham foundation,
in Quinby frames, prepared in the following
manner: The frame is wired by
sewing in 2 horizontal wires, spaced off
so that there will be 3 equal spaces
from the top bar down. I use a triangular
top bar and fasten the foundation
by pressing it down to the bar with
the thumb and then running a stream
of melted wax and rosin over it. Then
by running a wheel, made of a cent,
over the wire I imbed the wire into the
foundation; this also forms a groove in
the foundation in which I run a stream
of melted wax which covers the wire,
and when drawn out will be perfect and
will neither sag nor break out by extracting.
There should be a good half
inch of space between the foundation
and bottom bar, as it will settle enough
to bulge the comb if left full length.
To give it a thorough trial I hived 2
heavy natural colonies in one hive with
the mercury at 90 in the shade and basswood
honey coming in very fast, and
when drawn out every comb was perfect.
By bending a spoon so that it
will pour a small stream and with a little
practice, you will find it a short task
to fasten the foundation in the frames.</p>

Importing Bees from Italy.</h3>

<hr class="r25" />

<p class="center">CHAS. DADANT.</p>

<hr class="r25" />

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. A. Salisbury, under the above
heading, says that “It is no longer a
question: the Italian bee of Italy is not
a distinct race.... Later investigation
proves the fact that there are black bees
in Italy, as anywhere else, even in the
vicinity of Rome itself.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jones, at the Convention in Cincinnati
last fall, asserted that he had
seen black bees at several places in
Italy, even in the vicinity of Rome.
All my inquiries, as well as the reports
of prominent and disinterested bee-keepers
of Italy, such as Mr. Mona and
Dr. Dubini, prove that there are no hybrid
bees in Italy, and, of course, no
black bees.</p>

<p>Will Mr. Jones tell us in which apiaries
he saw black bees? Of course, by black
bees we understand entire colonies of
black bees. Then, he saw also colonies
of hybrid bees, for the mixing could
not be prevented. But if Mr. Jones saw
only a few black, or <i>seemingly black</i> bees,
in a colony, this circumstance, caused
either by the dark contents of their
stomachs, or by some other accidental
cause, we cannot infer from it that there
are black or impure bees in Italy. I
hope that Mr. Jones will answer this
question.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones adds that, in his opinion,
the Italian bees were descended from
the bees of Holy Land, or those on the
Island of Cyprus. Such an opinion
raises the question: Are the yellow bees
from Cyprus, from Syria, or from Italy,
the original bees; or the black bees, of
more northern climates, the original
bees, the yellow color being only an improvement?</p>

<p>According to the law of natural selection,
the yellow bees of these three
countries are about similar, because the
three countries enjoy a mild climate.
The idea of Mr. Jones’ that the Italian
bees descended from the bees of Cyprus
or of Syria, cannot be sustained, for it
leads to the idea of large importations
of bees from these countries, into Italy,
at a time when the means of transportation
were few, long and difficult.</p>

<p>The introduction of a few colonies of
these bees into Italy would have been
unable to effect the smallest change in
the race then existing; for by our introduction
of Italian bees we have experienced
how hard it is to overcome the
returning to the type which is prevalent
in a country. Besides, although we
have had too little time to study the
habits of the Cyprian bees, having received
our queens last summer only, we
have noticed that, while they resemble
in color the Italian, their habits are not
the same. For instance, the Cyprian
bees do not cling to the combs as persistently
as do the Italians, and resemble
more the blacks in this respect; the
Cyprian queens, like the common
queens, are more easily frightened, and
more difficult to find, than the Italian
queens.</p>

<p>As to their other qualities we are unable
to say anything. It will take a few
seasons to test them thoroughly. It is,
therefore, desirable to see them tested
by a great number of bee-keepers in
comparison with Italian bees.</p>

<p>I read in the Italian bee paper, <i>L’Apicoltore</i>,
for January, just received, that
the Central Society of Italian Bee-Keepers
will have an exhibition on the
first of May, to which the bee-keepers
are invited to send bees from every part
of the country (probably to answer the
assertion of Mr. Jones, that there are
black bees in Italy), in order to compare
the varieties which can exist on the entire
peninsula. The report of the commission
of this society will thus put an
end to the discussions between those
who contend that there are black bees
in Italy, and those who say that the
Italian bees are all pure. Yet, it is well
to remember here, that in Italy, as well
as in Germany, they count but two yellow
rings; for they do not count as a
ring the first segment, to which the thorax
is attached.</p>

Bees and Grapes.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>I notice that the question whether
bees destroy sound grapes is again being
discussed. I have been a bee-keeper
for 11 years and during most of
that time have raised grapes enough
for family use, and I have given considerable
time and attention to the
question under discussion. All my observations
go to show that bees do not
puncture sound grapes. I have seen
them sucking the juice from grapes
that had been broken by birds, and have
picked off the broken grape, and
watched the result. The bees would
run about over the bunch hunting for
an opening, and finally abandon the
search. Last season a great many
grapes were destroyed or injured in this
part of the country, and I gave the
matter special attention. Many of the
grapes cracked more or less from the
effects of rains following dry weather,
and many more were broken more or
less by birds. As forage was scarce the
bees worked industriously on these
broken grapes until they were all gone.
But on all the bunches there were some
grapes that were not broken, and these
remained on the vines until late in the
season. After the juice had been
sucked from all the broken skins I saw
the bees for many days vainly searching
for openings from which they might
obtain the supplies they had been accustomed
to draw from the broken
fruit. These sound grapes remained
on the vines, in some cases, for weeks
after the bees had ceased to get anything
from the broken ones. Now it is
plain that the juice of these very ripe
grapes would have been quite as acceptable
to them as that from the ones they
are accused of having punctured and
destroyed. And to my mind it is clear
that if they had punctured and
destroyed as many as they are accused
of doing, they would not have become
suddenly reformed as the grapes became
sweeter and more delicious. I will not
affirm that the bees cannot puncture the
skin of a grape, but I do affirm that as
far as my very careful observation enables
me to judge, they do not. And
if I am correct in this the injury done
to the grapes is very small. The injured
grapes would spoil in a few days if the
bees were not to touch them.</p>

<p>As far as I have been able to observe
wasps, hornets, &amp;c., do little injury to
grapes. The mischief results mostly
from the cracking of the skin, by a very
few days, even, of wet weather after it
has been dry for some time. The skin
of the grapes becomes so full that a jar
from the wind or from the alighting of
a bird on the bunch, will cause them to
crack, and then, if there is a dearth of
honey, they are sure to be sucked dry
by the bees, with more or less help
from yellow jackets, hornets, and
wasps. It is possible that in some cases
the skins are cut by wasps, &amp;c., but I
think the cases are exceptional.</p>

The Use of Separators for Box Honey.</h3>

<hr class="r25" />

<p class="center">GREINER BROTHERS.</p>

<hr class="r25" />

<blockquote>
<p>In starting an apiary it is of great importance
to adopt a hive that will prove
satisfactory to the manager, in all its
features, for the present as well as for
the future. It is not an easy matter after
an apiary has been started and hives
and appliances have accumulated, to
change the sizes or dimensions of such,
if they should not be satisfactory. In
the different manifestations of the hive
we find that it is necessary to have
brood frames and sections interchangeable,
in fact, it is still more convenient
to have all the different parts of the
hives as uniform as mechanical workmanship
can produce them, so that
frames, honey-boards, division-boards,
covers, sections, mats, &amp;c., may be
picked up anywhere and adjusted to
any hive desired.</p>

<p>The use of separators is another feature
of this kind; if once adopted and
the bees arranged accordingly, it may
cause considerable trouble to remodel
a lot of appliances, especially if separators
of any perceptible thickness are
used.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span> for Feb. 2, Mr.
Heddon gives some very good hints on
“hive and section making,” but we can
not endorse all his points, and in this article
we refer in particular to his closing
sentence.</p>

<p>It seems strange to us that Mr. Heddon
pronounces separators “nuisances,”
whilst other prominent bee-keepers,
and we believe the majority, use them
and advocate their use. It must certainly
be a query to young beginners,
who seek information amongst the contributors
of the <span class="smcap">Journal</span>, to encounter
such square contradictions. Our experience
is about as follows:</p>

<p>The 2 first years of our experience in
bee-keeping found us equipped with
open surplus cases, we mean by surplus
cases the adjustable half-story, with
the proper number of frames containing
sections. The seasons were
good and the crops abundant, but the
shape of a good share of our honey was
anything but desirable; it was not uniform
in thickness nor even; some being
thick on one end and thin on the
other, some were missed entirely, whilst
the adjoining one bulged out to take up
the space; in short, the variations were
many.</p>

<p>To glass and crate this honey for market
cost us considerable trouble and we
concluded to try separators. The 25
cases we had prepared and used the
next season at our honey apiary proved
to be a success; the honey was “just
splendid;” the sections in shape, thickness
and weight were as near perfect as
could be desired, and we decided at
once to produce honey in no other way.
However, we were not entirely satisfied;
we knew separators were objected
to by some bee-keepers on account of
a smaller yield. Mr. Heddon says, on
page 33 of the <span class="smcap">Journal</span>, “These separators
cost me too great a portion of my
surplus crop.”</p>

<p>To satisfy ourselves on this point we
used the following season about 100
cases, rigged as the first 25, with separators,
which we scattered in our different
apiaries side by side with open
ones. The result was that we noticed
very little difference, if any, in the
amount of honey stored, and the editor’s
opinion, on page 59, was exactly our experience.</p>

<p>Again, Mr. Heddon claims the first
cost and trouble of manipulating to be
objectionable. We admit separators
are an expense, but they need not be
very costly. We use basswood, costing
us less than a cent each, and even at
twice that cost, would it not be economy
then to expend a comparative
small amount if we can thereby produce
honey in much more attractive shape?
Besides we claim separators lessen the
trouble of manipulating instead of increasing
it. The reason we use wood
is because it is cheaper than metal and
we believe better adapted, on account
of its being the most natural material
for bee-habitations.</p>

<p>Since we introduced separators the
percentage of unfinished honey is
greatly reduced. At the end of the
honey season we formerly found open
cases almost filled with comb and
honey and not one single finished section
among them. This is not so much
the case since we use separators; when
the flow of honey begins to diminish,
we have noticed our bees to be at work
in a portion of the sections, whilst the
remainder would not be occupied at all;
we have also taken off cases at the end
of a honey flow, which were entirely
empty, except 2 or 3 sections, and these
were finished and marketable. To be
sure these are extremes, but it shows
the benefit of separators.</p>

<p>It might appear from the last part of
this article, that we apply surplus cases
regardless of the working capacity of
our colonies. Circumstances may
sometimes compel us to do so, but we
aim to give our bees no more surplus
room than they can occupy.</p>

Texas for Bees and Honey.</h3>

<p class="center">DR. J. E. LAY.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I write to answer several communications
in regard to the adaptability of
our great State to bee-keeping, and as
apiculture is engrossing the minds of
many of the most energetic, progressive
and scientific men of our land, I recognize
the difficulty of even venturing an
opinion. As our great State is so varied
in climate and flora, I will state that
my remarks have reference to my own
section of perhaps a radius of 100 miles.
I have lived in Texas since 1850. I
passed my boyhood days on her beautiful
prairies, amid her thousands of
flowers of every hue, freighting our incomparable
sea breeze with more than
Arcadian sweetness, silence banished
from her woodland slopes by the joyous
carol of beautiful song birds. Ever delighting
in the marvelous beauties of
nature, how could I fail to love so beauteous
a sunlit home? Yes, and as a
grown up boy I love it still. Greek nor
Roman, not even Wm. Tell, loved his
country better than I, therefore my
bee-keeping friends will pardon me if
I seem to color a little too strongly.
Our State is being filled with energetic
farmers who are reaping rich harvests
from the virgin soil, for nearly all kinds
of seeds that are sown spring forth under
the genial rays of the sun to 60 and
an hundred fold.</p>

<p>Reasoning by analogy I opine that
bee-keeping will result in like manner.
Apiculture is in its nascent form here,
but the sun of science begins to warm
its quickening form. I have studied
the best works on apiculture, but have
not given it a thorough practical test
yet; I purpose doing so this season.
There are but few bees in our country,
all blacks except my little apiary of 7
colonies, which consists of hybrids and
blacks. I intend to Italianize in March,
for they indeed possess many advantages
over the blacks.</p>

<p>I have just wintered successfully in
simplicity hives (plain) without any sort
of protection whatever, and this is the
coldest winter I ever saw in Texas.
Dispatches state that at this time almost
the entire North is covered with
snow. While my bees were in a quiver
of excitement to-day, Feb. 4, bringing
in rich loads of pollen and honey from
turnips, mustards, &amp;c., I could but

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>

delight in their rush of joy. How different
is the climate over which our
vast brotherhood reaches! Our honey
plants reach nearly through the entire
year, yielding as good nectar as ever
tickled the palate of man. In fact the
harvest for bees is almost endless, better,
of course, some months. The market
for honey has never been developed:
a few old “gums” to “rob” for “big
meeting” or for some extraordinary
visitor is about all ever obtained. “Bees
do no good here these days, the moth
destroy them,” say the “old settlers.”
The moth skulks away in the light of
scientific bee-keeping and its depredations
are <i>nil</i>.</p>

<p>To be successful all should study the
science, read good books on the subject,
learn by close practical observation,
read the periodicals of our wide awake
bee-men, among which there is none
better than the <span class="smcap">American Bee Journal</span>.
Energy and perseverance alone
will succeed even in the “sunlit clime”
of Texas. Without these, all will just
as surely retrograde.</p>

Alsike Clover as a Honey Plant.</h3>

<hr class="r25" />

<p class="center">L. JAMES.</p>

<hr class="r25" />

<blockquote>
<p>Much has been written for the <span class="smcap">Journal</span>
about the value of this variety of
clover for its yield of honey and hay.
Such has not been my experience with
it, sown on 19 acres of land, and extending
over 11 years. In 1869 I bought
some 38 pounds of the seed of Mr.
Thomas, of Canada. The cost to me,
of the seed, duty and express charges,
was $18. Having 9 acres of ground
planted with apple trees that had been
bearing for some time, and wishing to
seed it down to grass I had the ground
well prepared for the reception of the
seed, and a good rain fell just after it
was brushed in; it came up nicely, and
as there was favorable rains all through
the summer it grew finely. The following
season it grew in length of stem and
quantity of bloom far beyond my expectation,
and when in its full bloom it
was a beautiful sight, resembling an
ocean of blossoms, and as I looked upon
it, you may rely upon it my calculations
of boxes of nice alsike clover honey
loomed up in large proportions, but like
many another calculation based upon
what our bees are going to do, it was
all in fancy and I was doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>Day after day their flight was just in
the opposite direction, with only here
and there a bee to be seen on it. There
was a body of timber ¾ of a mile distant
in the direction they were flying with
pastures well set in white clover between
this timber and the apiary, and I
supposed the white clover pastures
was the source of honey supply. This
state of things continued for some time,
and seeing a bee-man pass by that lived
in the timber I inquired how his bees
were getting along. He replied they
were doing finely as they ought to, for
he had never seen heavier honey dews.
That was the secret, and soon my boxes
began to show evidence of the dark stuff
being put into them, instead of alsike
honey. Fortunately for me, before
much of it was stored in the boxes,
some heavy dashing rains washed it
from the leaves and there was no more
of the dew for them to gather. The alsike
and white clover were in bloom for
some time after this, but for some cause
the bees paid but little attention to it,
and I was vexed to see the promise of a
rich return for my expenditure frustrated.
I took it for granted that the
season was not congenial for its production
of honey, as I knew the same
to be the case with white clover, as it
was last summer. After this at different
times I sowed 2 other orchards of 5
acres each with alsike, neither of which
did as well as the first piece sown, want
of timely rains, &amp;c., being the cause,
but by continuous sowing I succeeded
in having them tolerably well set with it.</p>

<p>Receiving no perceptible benefit from
it, commensurate with its trouble and
expense, I have for some time been
satisfied that in central Illinois where
our white clover is so abundantly furnished
in our pastures and road sides,
without any expense, and hardy at that,
it is time and money put to a poor use.</p>

<p>As a hay producing plant it amounts
to but little after the first season, as it
becomes dwarfed in habit, and, I believe,
will eventually be but little larger
in growth under like circumstances
than the white variety. The white
clover is the honey plant for our latitude,
and I presume the alsike for
Sweden, from whence it came, and
corresponding latitudes. After having
had 11 years’ experience with it I think
it unworthy of attention from bee-men,
either for honey or hay; at least where
the hardy white clover comes spontaneously
to our hands.</p>

<p>There is one thing I ought not to
omit, in sowing this Canadian seed I
introduced a kind of cockle (different
from any I have seen in Penn. or Ohio)
that holds its own much better than
the clover, and I begin to think it will
be a standing pest difficult to get rid of.</p>

The Supply and Queen Trade.</h3>

<hr class="r25" />

<p class="center">A. B. WEED.</p>

<hr class="r25" />

<blockquote>
<p>This is a subject, I believe, of interest
to all who are engaged in apiculture,
either as bee-keepers, supply dealers or
queen breeders, and is growing as the
business extends.</p>

<p>The supply business seems as yet to
be in a crude state, and prices lack uniformity.
In many cases we find needless
“cutting” of prices. It may be
said that this is a good thing for buyers;
but I believe that the opposite is the
case, for the inevitable result of unreasonably
low prices is inferior goods.
When prices are so lowered that there
is no margin left for profit, the trade
will not be supported with the enterprise
which is necessary to stimulate
improvements or inventions, or even to
put the business on a good footing.
The character of the business can best
be maintained if the energy of manufacturers
is directed to the perfecting
of goods rather than the cheapening of
them. Good tools are necessary in any
pursuit, and seem to be associated with
a thrifty business; in fact, the prosperity
of a business is largely dependent
upon the means at hand of carrying it
on. If one tool is better than another&mdash;even
if the difference is slight&mdash;it is
worth very much more, for the benefit
of the difference is felt every time that
it is used. A good thing may be a
source of profit, and a poor one of loss.
The best is <i>always</i> the cheapest.</p>

<p>There is one respect in which the
business is in a better condition than
many others, and that is, that there is
but very little credit given. This is an
advantage to both parties, for the
seller loses nothing through bad debts,
and the prompt buyer does not have to
pay for the losses caused by the careless
or dishonest ones.</p>

<p>It is quite common among supply
dealers to guarantee safe arrival of
goods. This condition of sale is unnecessary,
as the express receipt is sufficient,
and in case of injury or loss the
fact is more readily proven and damages
more easily collected than could be
from some dealers. It is unreasonable
to expect the dealer to be responsible
for goods after they have left his hands,
especially when the consignee can adjust
any difficulty more easily at his end
of the line; this is the customary rule
in business. When articles are sent by
mail the buyer can protect himself
against loss by having the article registered;
but the precaution is almost
unnecessary, as it is <i>very rarely</i> that
anything is lost in the mails. Of course
the sender is required to use necessary
care in packing; with most shippers this
is a point of pride.</p>

<p>The traffic in queens seems to be
closely allied to the supply business&mdash;at
least so I have found it&mdash;for as the bee-keeper
begins to feel the need of good
tools he sees the advantage of good
stock as well; and he naturally looks
in the same direction for both. I believe
that I express the opinion of the
best queen breeders when I say that it
is much more satisfactory to sell a good
queen at a correspondingly good price&mdash;even
if the profit is no greater in proportion&mdash;than
a cheap and poor one, for
the reason that a queen, wherever she
goes, will represent the stock from
which she came. And I believe, too,
that I speak the opinion of all observing
apiarists when I say that it pays infinitely
better to keep good queens than
poor ones. Thus it is that good queens
at good prices are more profitable to
both parties. Some of the best apiarists
have discontinued selling any queens
that are not possessed of a high degree
of merit, and send out only those which
are thoroughly tested and found to be
good. In return they receive a suitable
price from appreciative customers. This
is notably the case in localities where
honey raising is an established business,
and the value of good stock is therefore
understood. It is now almost universally
held by apiarists that if good
queens are to be obtained they must be
raised under favorable conditions. It
is freely admitted that to bring about
these conditions requires a large outlay
of time and thought, as well as money.
This especially is the case when queens
are to be reared out of season.</p>

<p>The cost of rearing queens will decide
their price, for of course they will
not be sold at prices which do not pay
for rearing and a reasonable profit besides.
If buyers insist on having cheap
queens, they will get them, but their
value will be found to correspond with
their price. The one-price rule, which
is applied to queens throughout the
country, has the effect of causing many
poor ones to be sold at fair prices, which
really should be killed. It has the tendency
to discourage the rearing of very
superior ones, for as a rule, a thing is
no better than its price. When they
are all sold at a uniform price it is to be
expected they will be nearly alike in
merit, as there is no special inducement
for the breeder to improve his stock.
The uniformity of price probably originated
in the supposition that all queens
are equally good, whereas experience
proves the opposite to be true. A queen
that lays even a few more eggs daily
than another is much more valuable,
for the extra number of eggs will be
multiplied by the number of days that
she is kept. This difference alone, so
often repeated, will in time amount to
more than the price of the queen. A
poor queen is kept at a corresponding
loss, although both may have sold at the
same price. There are such things as
plus and minus outside of algebra. The
buying of queens at present has some
resemblance to a lottery. They should
be graded&mdash;at least so far as this is possible&mdash;and
priced accordingly.</p>

<p>Combinations for the maintenance
of artificial prices are impracticable
and undesirable. I would only submit
that prices be based upon cost of production
and a <i>reasonable</i> profit.</p>

Who is to Blame for the Losses?</h3>

<hr class="r25" />

<p class="center">C. H. DIBBERN.</p>

<hr class="r25" />

<blockquote>
<p>Already the reports of fearful losses
are coming in thick and fast. Every
severe winter the story is the same.
Now the question arises, are these losses
of bees inevitable every cold winter?
If so then our business as bee-keepers
is still a mere matter of luck.</p>

<p>During the last few years of mild
winters the out-door wintering men
have had things about their own way
in our bee-papers. Now, are these papers
not a little to blame for admitting
articles to their columns giving bad advice
to the inexperienced? Many have
advocated the wintering on summer
stands without protection or care, and
persistently claim to be masters in bee-keeping.
I am perfectly willing to admit
that bees can be wintered very
nicely on summer stands in a mild winter,
also that they are wintered successfully
if well packed in chaff in a cold
winter; but I claim that the labor of
preparing them is more than double
that of cellar wintering.</p>

<p>I contend that the only certain way is
to prepare a suitable place especially
for the bees. If a cellar, have the floor
cemented and see that it is dry, dark,
and well ventilated. In such a place
they will not consume more than half
the amount of honey they would if left
out “packed” in the most approved
style. This being a fact they have no
particular occasion for a flight. I know
that the out-door men claim that cellar-wintered
bees do not breed early and
are liable to “spring dwindle.” I
hardly know what spring dwindling is.
By good spring management I have
never failed to have my hives crowded
as soon as there is anything for the bees
to do. Then what is to be gained by
having the queen expend her energies
and raising vast broods of bees in February
to be ready to die when the blossoms
come? But sometimes failure
comes even in the best of cellars; but
would they have fared any better out of
doors? Nine times in 10 the cause can
be traced to bees filling their hives from
the refuse of cider mills. How to keep
them from storing such stuff is one of
the great problems to be solved.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that any kind
of a hole under a house will do to winter
bees. I have known bees to be
packed away among onions, cabbage,
and sour kraut. In the spring they
wonder what made their bees die. Perhaps
they were fastened by wire cloth
so that the light could be let in and the
bees could not “get out you know.”
That such must fail is apparent.</p>

<p>I do not find fault with those who prefer
to pack in chaff and winter out of
doors; I cannot see, however, that it is
the best way.</p>

<p>It will be the “survival of the fittest”
this winter, sure. The box hive men
and careless bee-keepers will go out of
the business. It is the golden opportunity
for the bee-keeper of the future.
Soon the fields will be white with the
harvest, but the laborers will be few.
The bees will have less competition in
the fields and the honey in the market.</p>

<p class="sig5">Milan, Ill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Are the papers reprehensible for giving
place to candid and respectful arguments,
whether based upon tenable or
doubtful theories, intended to advance
and simplify a science of such magnitude
as the bee-keeping interest? Differences
of opinion (and honest ones,
too,) exist in almost all leading pursuits,
and frequently, although seemingly
contradicting each other, lead to successful
results: again, as has been frequently
demonstrated during the past
winter, practices embracing all the most
approved theories, have alike proved
disastrous. There are so many favorable
contingencies to be provided, that
theories are powerless to insure success.
It is interesting, as well as mystifying,
to glance through our correspondence
from week to week, and note the different
methods of preparing bees for winter,
and the disasters attending all the
different styles. Nor are the cellars exempt
from heavy losses, even where
success has been proverbial heretofore:
The truth is, the winter has been an exceptional
one, and loss or success with a
single or a few individuals, will neither
establish nor disprove theoretical assertions;
nor will it justify the “I told you
so” class, because successful, in arrogating
to themselves all of human wisdom.&mdash;

<p>Mr. Jones sends us the annexed extract
from a letter of Mr. Benton’s, and
the following appreciative compliment
to the <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span>, for which he will
accept our thanks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Herewith I send you extract from a
private letter just received from Frank
Benton, dated Pointe de Galle, Ceylon,
Asia, Jan. 30, 1881. The <span class="smcap">American
Bee Journal</span> has a warm corner in my
heart. Right glad am I that you have
taken time by the forelock, and issued
a weekly. I would not have you go
back to a monthly for $25 a year, and
you deserve the congratulations of every
bee-keeper; that prosperity may crown
your efforts is my wish.</p>

<p class="sig5"><span class="smcap">D. A. Jones.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Jones</span>:&mdash;* * * I shall start
back with nothing but full colonies. I
have seen two native races of bees here,
and the comb of a third; one race is
stingless, but worthless; the tiniest
little fellows, three-sixteenths of an inch
long. Another race is <i>Apis indica</i>.
The third race I do not believe is valuable,
since it is a very small bee&mdash;smaller
than <i>Apis indica</i>. <i>Apis dorsata</i> is a wonderful
bee, whether it can be domesticated
or not. It builds in the open air,
on branches, often making combs 6 feet
long; and I have good authority for
saying that 30 natives have each taken
a load of honey from one tree. It was
not until I reached Colombo that I could
find out anything about <i>Apis dorsata</i>.
I call it <i>Apis dorsata</i>, but do not know
positively as that is its name, for no one
can tell here, and I have not yet seen the
bee, as it was too late when I learned
where to find it, to go to that part of the
Island and reach this French steamer.
Everybody says, though, a large bee,
from which large quantities of honey
are obtained, exists in the interior of
the Island. The natives all know it by
the name <i>Bombera</i>. I start for Singapore
by the French steamer “Yangste,”
on January 31st.</p>

An Excellent Suggestion.</h3>

<hr class="r25" />

<p>Prof. Cook has forwarded us for publication
the annexed open letter, addressed
to Dr. N. P. Allen, President of
the North American Bee-Keepers’ Society.
The reasons adduced in support of
the suggestion are well founded, and
must strike all minds favorably. September
and October are usually among
the busiest months of the year to bee-keepers
and farmers, who have their
later crops to garner, their honey to
take off and prepare for market, their
fruit to gather and assort, and their live
stock to be made comfortable for winter;
while the date proposed by the Professor
occurs just at that period when everybody
can spare the time best, when traveling
is the most enjoyable, and is quite
late enough to enable an approximate
estimate of what the harvest will be.
It is competent for the Executive Committee
(of which President Allen is
chairman) to fix upon such time as will
best subserve the interests of the Society.
We trust they will give the matter
an early and careful consideration.
Following is the letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>To Dr. N. P. Allen:</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: As the proposition which
I am about to offer is of general interest
to the bee-keepers of our country, I
beg leave to present it through the
<span class="smcap">American Bee Journal</span>:</p>

<p>The American Association for the Advancement
of Science convenes at Cincinnati,
Ohio, on Wednesday, Aug. 17,
1881. This Association had at its last
meeting, in Boston, August, 1880, more
than 1,000 members present. Owing to
its influence, and the large annual attendance,
the local committee at the
place where the meetings are to be held
are able to procure greatly reduced
rates on railroads leading to the place.</p>

<p>Now, I would suggest that the North
American Bee-Keepers’ Association,
which is to be held so near Cincinnati,
convene at Lexington on Wednesday
and Thursday, August 24th and 25th.</p>

<p>1st. This would accommodate such
persons as myself, who wish to attend
both meetings, and could not afford time
or means were they widely separated by
time.</p>

<p>2d. A committee consisting of yourself,
Mr. Muth, of Cincinnati, and Mr. Wm.
Williamson, of Lexington (I would do
what I could to aid), could act in conjunction
with the local committee of the
A. A. A. of S., and I believe could get
the commutation railroad rates to extend
to the National Bee-Keepers’ Association.</p>

<p>3d. August is a quiet time with bee-keepers,
and so far as I can see, nothing
would be lost in making the date of our
meeting earlier than the usual time.</p>

<p>4th. The fact of accommodating such
as wish to attend both meetings, and
the reduced railroad rates, could we secure
them, would greatly increase the
attendance at the Bee-Keepers’ Association,
and would richly compensate
for some loss, if such there would be.</p>

<p>I only make this suggestion, hoping
that you and others interested will give
it such consideration as its merits deserve.</p>

much pleasure, that Mr. Root has succeeded
in having it include honey, and
Mr. R. is quite sanguine that the bill so

&mdash;The Klassen and
Krock difficulty about the bees of the
former committing depredations on the
grapes of the latter, is to be submitted
to arbitration. It seems that the real
trouble was a “personal feud that does
not concern bee-keepers at all”&mdash;the
grape matter was an outgrowth. This
matter was referred to in Prof. Cook’s
article on page 74 of the <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span>,
and should now be entirely divorced
from the Bee and Grape controversy.</p>

was almost entirely blind. His family
was sick, and I presented him with a
pail of honey. What they did not eat
he put in his eyes, a drop or two in each
eye, 2 or 3 times a day. In 3 months’
time he was able to read coarse print,
and now, after 4 months’ use, his eyes
are almost as good as ever. I have also
found honey good for common cold-sore
eyes.”</p>

<p><a name="Feeding_In_Winter" id="Feeding_In_Winter"></a><b>Feeding in Winter.</b>&mdash;Mr. A. B. Weed,
in the <i>Michigan Farmer</i>, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Many colonies which were put up
for winter with but a small amount of
provision, have consumed what was
given them, and starved for want of
more. Others have but a small amount
of stores left, and must be fed soon if
they are to be saved. The best way to
feed such is to give them frames of well
ripened honey, but this the weather
will not always permit. The next best
thing for them is candy; this can be
given at any time, and can be laid on
top of the frames. If the cluster is low
down in the hive, it should be put down
into it, where it can be reached.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="r25" />

<p><a name="Bees_and_Grapes_Exch2" id="Bees_and_Grapes_Exch2"></a><b>Bees and Grapes.</b>
&mdash;Mr. W. H. Stout,
in the Lancaster, Pa., <i>Farmer</i>, gives the
following as his experience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By close investigation I have satisfied
myself that bees do not destroy sound
grapes. I had, during the past season,
22 colonies of Italian and common black
bees; all the hives were in close proximity
to the grapes, while a number had
the vines trained over them for shade
during the heat of summer. The grapes
are of the Concord variety, of which I
had an abundance of fine fruit, some
clusters of which grew within 18 inches
of the entrance to the hives. Bunches
of the grapes remained on the vines until
the frost had killed the foliage, which
fell off and left the grapes exposed, affording
every temptation to the bees;
and this, too, through a season when the
honey yield from natural sources was so
small that the bees consumed stores they
had gathered earlier in the season. But
the bees do work on grapes, and also on
other fruits under certain conditions.
If the skin of grapes, peaches, pears,
etc., is ruptured from any cause, the
bees, wasps, ants, etc., are very quick
in discovering it, and soon leave only
the dried shells. During the hot weather
of August, especially when there are
frequent showers, the skin of ripening
fruit cracks, for reasons which I will
leave to some philosophical friend to explain.
My conclusions are not hasty;
nor were my observations superficial;
but they were prolonged from the time
the first grapes ripened until the close
of the season. I found some clusters of
grapes literally covered with bees scrambling
and fighting for the little sweets
contained in the cracked grapes, which
are the only ones on which they work,
as I found out by driving the bees away
and removing from the clusters all the
bursted grapes, when the bees, as soon
as they found only sound fruit remained,
went away and left the grapes uninjured.
We also laid some bunches of
grapes on top of the hives and others
close to the entrances, also left clusters
hanging on the vines close to the hives,
where they remained uninjured by the
bees as long as the fruit was sound. I
know very well that bees can gnaw
through heavy muslin, or shave off wood
and straw. To cover the bees we have
quilts made of heavy muslin, which
they sometimes bite through, and we
have wood and straw hives on which
they have enlarged the entrances; but,
nevertheless, I am fully satisfied they
do no injury whatever to sound fruit.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="r25" />

<p><a name="Feeding_RyeMeal" id="Feeding_RyeMeal"></a><b>Feeding Rye-Meal.</b>
&mdash;In the <i>Indiana Farmer</i> Mr. F. L. Dougherty says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Bees will not raise brood without
pollen in some shape. We frequently
find colonies with but very little, and at
times none at all. In crowding them
on a few frames, quite frequently those
left in the hive contain but little, if any.
So it becomes necessary to furnish it to
them, until they can gather it from natural
sources. Unbolted rye-meal is
probably the best substitute, although
they will use wheat-flour, corn-meal,
oat-meal, or in lieu of any of these, will
even carry saw-dust. To get the bees
started, place a piece of comb on the
meal, and if the weather be pleasant
and no pollen to be had they will soon
appropriate it. They will leave the
meal when natural pollen makes its appearance.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We have received the first 2 numbers

Mr. T. G. Newman. Only one apiarian
publication is issued every 2 weeks, the
<i>Bienen-Zeitung</i> of Eickstadt. That of Mr.
Newman’s is, therefore, ‘the only one
in the entire world which is published
weekly.’ It is also, without doubt, the
most universal. Its principal contributors
are among the most distinguished
bee-keepers of America, together with
scientists, entomologists, chemists and
farmers; and the number of those who
send it communications can be called
legion. It is, with an understanding
of the full extent of the services
which it renders, through the abundance
of the observations and of the information
which it brings before its
readers, that we offer to our colleague
and friend our warmest felicitations on
the occasion of the new development of
his publication.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This very kind notice is the more
valuable as Mons. E. Bertrand is a man

Out of 33 colonies, I think I have 10 or
12 alive, some of them pretty strong,
others weak. I have 3 Italian colonies&mdash;they
seem strongest. What hives I
have looked into, where the bees are
dead, appear to have plenty of honey,
and the other bees appear to be taking
the honey out, and I fear are taking
from the weak colonies also. Should I
prevent them from appropriating it? I
noticed some drones with one of my
Italian colonies; what does that mean
at this time of year? I have been a
short distance south, returning home 3

<p>[It is not advisable to let bees have
access to combs in other hives; if they
need honey, put the combs in the hives
where wanted, and not too many. If
the strong are robbing the weaker colonies,
exchange stands with them. The
presence of drones thus early indicates
an old or defective queen. Unless there
is a large quantity of sealed worker
brood (indicating the queen is perfect),
we would supersede her as soon as possible,
unless the bees save the trouble.

for honey, they did not fill up; 29 were

the outside frames and put in cushions
made by covering empty frames with
sacking and filling with chaff; also 2
inches of the same on the top of the

5 in the same manner, but left them on

I was sure would starve if not fed, I removed
to a room over another where a
fire is kept, placed them at a window
and arranged a passage leading outside;
then, with wire cloth over the frames, I
can feed and examine without their flying
out. They are all right. One I left
on the summer stand with a set of section
boxes, unprotected, and it is very
strong. On March 9th my bees had
their first good flight since Oct. 25. I

young bees, and had a queen cell just

2 sent out a swarm; it was queenless,

will long be remembered by the bee-keepers
in this locality. I commenced
the winter with 9 colonies of bees, all
carefully packed in chaff on the summer
stands with plenty of nice sealed
honey. They were packed on the 13th
day of last Nov., and from that until
the present time (121 days) there has
not been a single day that the bees
could safely fly, and the consequence is
my bees are all dead, from the effects
of their long confinement. They left
plenty of honey, but the combs are
badly soiled. I am not discouraged,
however, and shall try again. A gentleman
living not far from here had
only 8 colonies left out of 39, 2 weeks
ago, and when spring condescends to
smile on us again we think it will not
need a returning board to count the
bees in this county. I am well pleased

one for honey; we had a cold spell in
Nov.; then had warm weather for 2

rob. The pure Italians behaved well,
neither robbed nor let the others rob
them. I used water and kerosene oil,
but it was of no use; at last I hit upon
a remedy. My hives have the bottom
boards projecting in front. I ripped
out one-inch square pieces 5 inches
long, cut coarse wire cloth 2x6, bent it
lengthwise in the middle, tacked on
2 sides of each block, leaving wire about
5 inches to give them air; I drove a nail
through each end and nailed it in front
of each hive. Every 10 or 15 days when
the weather was fine, an hour before
night, I let them out to have a fly. We
have had fine weather for the last 2
weeks. I let the bees out on Jan 30;
they have been busy carrying in pollen

their stealing propensities. I

<p>[Pure green tea, well steeped, is used
by many to detect the presence of glucose
in honey. If the honey dissolves
without changing the color of the tea,
it is supposed to be pure. But in these

matter of doubt whether the tea is pure;
again, if, as is claimed, glucose is sometimes
manufactured without leaving
sulphuric acid or other deleterious substances
in it, then the tea would hardly
expose it when mixed with honey. Alcohol
is also used to detect the presence
of glucose; but besides being frequently
inconvenient to obtain, it requires considerable
skill in its use.</p>

loss what to think about bee preservation
during the winter season. I had 12
colonies last fall; I packed 6 with chaff
6 inches thick around them, and have 1
colony left of the lot. There is honey
in the combs, but the bees are all dead.
I put 3 colonies in the cellar; 2 of them
are alive, but in a bad condition, the
combs being dirty and moldy. I left 3
on the summer stands, and 1 is yet alive.
None died for want of honey; there was
plenty of food for them in the hives.
The 6 were put into the chaff in the latter
part of November, and taken out on
the 8th of March. The combs look
clean and free from mold. About a
week before I took them out of the chaff
I had taken off the front boards, and
finding the bees alive, shut them up
again. Upon taking them out this was
the only colony that was alive. When
I took the chaff off, the bees were
crowded around the entrance ready to
fly, which they did at once, and had a
lively time until they were driven inside
by the approach of night. Do you think
the other 5 colonies were dead the first
time I looked at them? They had a
passage through the chaff 1 inch high
by 4 wide. A friend of mine here had
4 colonies wintered outside, with an old
piece of sail-cloth over them, and only
lost one, while old bee-keepers, with

find some bee-keepers, some who keep
bees, and those that let the bees keep
themselves. Mr. H. had 3 colonies, all
are dead; Mr. L. had 7, one left; Mr. D.
left his 11 colonies without protection
and now has 11 empty hives for sale;
Mr. B. let the winters’ blast try his 20
colonies and now has 12 empty hives;
Mr. F. packed 37 in chaff and has 11
left; Mr. A. put up 57 in complete order,
but with all his precaution all are dead;
Mr. B. put into winter quarters 73 colonies
of fine Italians, 58 of them are
dead. I packed in clover-chaff 101 colonies,
and 23 have gone the way of all
the earth. My bees were confined in
their hives from Oct. 20 until March 6.
I packed 24 in Langstroth hives with
space the whole width of hive left open,
to give plenty of fresh air, yet at the
same time warm, with a due amount of
packing, and in this lot have not lost
one colony, and very few bees; but the
end is not yet. To-day I found young
bees with brood in all stages.</p>

<b>No Loss In Wintering.</b>&mdash;Nearly all the
bees in this vicinity that were left to
care for themselves are extinct. I had
14 colonies packed comfortably in chaff
before the cold weather commenced,
and have not lost any yet. I am highly
pleased with the Weekly <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span>,

<p><a name="Poor_Season_but_Fair_Profit" id="Poor_Season_but_Fair_Profit"></a>
<b>Poor Season but Fair Profit.</b>&mdash;After
selling my surplus colonies, I commenced
the season of 1880 with 37 colonies
in fair condition; increased by
division and natural swarming to 63,
and 12 nuclei. I reared 30 Cyprian and
Italian queens; had 100 Gallup frames
of foundation drawn out, and extracted
400 lbs. of honey. Estimating the increase
at $6 per colony, and deducting
the expenses, my income for care and
labor is $250, or about $6.50 for each
colony in the spring. I put 75 colonies,
in fair condition (including the 12 nuclei),
into winter quarters Dec. 8; some
were short of stores, and all had poor
honey. On March 1st I found 8 colonies
and 4 nuclei dead&mdash;4 starved and 8 died
from the effect of poor honey and long
confinement. More of them are diseased
and must have a flight soon or die.
With the loss of stock already mentioned,
and allowing for more to follow,
the credit will be cut down to $3.50 per
colony. The season has been the poorest
I ever knew, but even $3.50 is a fair
profit on the investment. White clover
gave no honey; basswood lasted only 10
days, but yielded well; had it lasted 2
weeks longer I should have had an average
yield of honey for the season.
Without this flow of basswood honey,
the bees must have been fed, but now
they have enough stores to carry them
through till spring. As the heavy snows
have no doubt preserved the clover, the
outlook for honey this summer is good.
I hardly need say that I am pleased
with the Weekly <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span>.</p>

<p><a name="Planting_Buckwheat_for_a_Honey_Yield" id="Planting_Buckwheat_for_a_Honey_Yield"></a>
<b>Planting Buckwheat for a Honey Yield.</b>&mdash;In
answer to Mr. A. Hodges, on page
78, I will say that buckwheat is a peculiar
plant about yielding honey. I have
never known it to fail here in yielding
enough honey for the bees’ winter
stores, and usually very much more; in
other localities in the same latitude, it
cannot be relied on at all for a honey
crop. It seems, however, that it never
yields through the entire season in
which it can be made to bloom. Quite
a large amount of it is cultivated every
season in my vicinity, much of it generally
coming into full bloom as early as
the middle of July, yet I have never
known it to yield any honey earlier than
the 1st of August, and very rarely before
the 10th; but when it commences to
yield honey, it does so profusely until
the plant itself is ripe, or killed by frost.
I would say to Mr. Hodges, or any one
else intending the sowing of successive
crops of buckwheat, that it is useless to
sow any early in the season, to blossom
before the 1st of August. I am intending
to sow about 20 acres of it this season
for my bees. I shall put the first
crop of it in the ground about June 25;
the rest about July 10. That from the
last sowing will remain in bloom until
frost comes, even if that is delayed later
than ordinary.</p>

<p>HONEY.&mdash;The “Vigilant” takes 600 cases to Liverpool.
There is a slightly improved feeling consequent
upon a little more inquiry, but prices show no
material appreciation. Discouraging reports are received
from the southern part of the State, as to the
prospects of the coming crop, but other sections give
promise of an abundant yield. With a good supply
yet on the market, prices are not apt to be buoyant
until the anticipated failure is more fully settled.

<p><b>Wilbor’s Cod-Liver Oil and Lime.</b>&mdash;Persons
who have been taking Cod-Liver Oil will be pleased
to learn that Dr. Wilbor has succeeded, from directions
of several Professional gentlemen, in combining
the pure Oil and Lime in such a manner that it is
pleasant to the taste, and its effects in Lung complaints
are truly wonderful. Very many persons
whose cases were pronounced hopeless, and who had
taken the clear Oil torn long-time without marked
effect, have been entirely cured by using this preparation.
